#Two approaches: 
 
- We will develop this website using self-developed Python regular expression and Scrapy (a fast high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages) using Agile Development Model. 

- <div style="font-size:35px"><b> Self-developed Python regular expression:</b></div>
<i>We are going to use python urllib module which opens a communication link with a URL to download the raw content of the web site. Then we parse the raw content using regular expression and design data structure to store the information.</i>
<p>Follow our public repository <a href="https://github.com/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/ProjectScraping">ProjectScraping</a> in Github</p>
- <div style="font-size:35px"><b>Scrapy:</b></div> 
<i>Scrapy is an open-course and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites in a fast, simple, yet extensible way.</i>
