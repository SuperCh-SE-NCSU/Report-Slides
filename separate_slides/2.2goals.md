#Goals:  

- Develop a website, offering car buyers the integrated information of used cars, based on customers’ needs and several most useful factors (model, year, website link and price range).

-  To be more specific, based on a customer’s needs(car model, year of make, mileage,etc) we find the posts on craiglist, which agree with the customer’s needs and look up the price for the car on sale on the post from Kbb. 
Then our website will show the customer the posts(link to the original posts on craiglist) with cars he is interested in on sale and the price from Kbb. 
- Advantage: Right now, people have to go to craiglist to find the car they are interested in with a seller’s price, and then go to kbb, checking out the review price.It’s a pain to look up cars’ kbb price again and again.
Our website will do the two jobs for customers automatically, and people can get updated information emailed to them from our website’s subscription service.
